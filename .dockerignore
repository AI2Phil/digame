# If models are explicitly copied from a specific source (e.g. root ./models)
# and we don't want other versions from the main app code copy to interfere
# or be unnecessarily included if they are just dev artifacts.
# The Dockerfile currently copies ./digame to /app/digame
# and ./models to /app/digame/app/models.
# If ./digame/app/models exists on the host and contains e.g. example models,
# they would first be copied by `COPY digame /app/digame`, then the contents of
# ./models would be copied into /app/digame/app/models.
# To keep it clean and ensure only models from root ./models are used,
# we can ignore the host's ./digame/app/models.
