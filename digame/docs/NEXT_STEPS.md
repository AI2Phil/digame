# Next Steps for Digame Platform Development

This document outlines the immediate next steps for the Digame platform, focusing on stabilizing the current features, and then suggests future development directions based on the project blueprint.

## I. Immediate Actions & Verification (Post Docker Setup)
The following steps have been completed or are in progress. Some were previously blocked due to environmental constraints but have now been addressed.

### 0. Completed Actions
- Fixed circular import issues in the codebase
- Added missing Body import in process_notes_router.py
- Successfully restarted Docker containers and verified backend service is running
- Verified all model files exist and have content in both models/ and digame/app/models/ directories
- Fixed duplicate router prefixes by removing prefixes from individual router files
- Fixed incorrect import in process_notes_router.py (now importing get_db directly from db module)
- Removed unnecessary code in admin_rbac_router.py
- Verified all API endpoints are now accessible with correct paths
### 1. Verify/Regenerate Model Files ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Issue:
Key model and preprocessor files in models/(primary) and potentially digame/app/models/(examples) were reported as empty. This might be due to disk space errors during their generation.

### Action Taken:
a.  Inspected Files:
Manually checked the following files in the local repository for content:
* ‚úÖ models/predictive_model.pth (624,649 bytes)
* ‚úÖ models/activity_encoder.joblib (531 bytes)
* ‚úÖ models/scaler.joblib (879 bytes)
* ‚úÖ models/user_encoder.joblib (94 bytes)
* ‚úÖ digame/app/models/example_custom_model.pth (65,505 bytes)
* ‚úÖ Associated .joblib files for example_custom_model.pth in digame/app/models/

b.  Conclusion:
All model files exist and have appropriate content. No regeneration is necessary at this time.

c.  Next Steps:
Continue with testing the API endpoints to ensure the models are loaded correctly and function as expected.

### 2. Test Dockerized Application Locally (Deployment Steps)
This section outlines the steps to build, run, and test the application using the Docker setup.
‚úÖ Initial Docker setup has been successfully tested and verified.

Prerequisites:
* Docker & Docker Compose installed.
* Repository files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.) from main branch.
* Crucially: Valid model files in the ./models/ directory at the root.

a. Build Docker Images: Navigate to the repository root and run: `docker-compose build`

b. Start Services: `docker-compose up -d` (View logs with `docker-compose up` if needed).

c. Check Service Logs:
   * `docker-compose logs --tail=50 backend`
   * `docker-compose logs --tail=50 db`
   * Ensure Uvicorn starts for the backend and PostgreSQL is ready.
   * ‚úÖ Backend service is now starting successfully without errors.

d. Test API Endpoints:
   * ‚úÖ Root: `curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/` (Expected: {"message":"Welcome to the Digame API"})
   * ‚úÖ API Docs: Open http://localhost:8000/docs in a browser.
   * ‚úÖ Predictive Endpoint: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_id": 1, "recent_activity_types": ["email", "document", "meeting", "email", "browser"]}' http://localhost:8000/predictive/predict`
     (Note: This endpoint requires authentication. Returns {"detail":"Not authenticated"} without proper auth token.)
   * ‚úÖ Admin RBAC Endpoint: `curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/admin/rbac/roles/`
     (Note: This endpoint requires authentication. Returns {"detail":"Not authenticated"} without proper auth token.)
   * ‚úÖ Process Notes Endpoint: `curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/process-notes/users/1/notes`
     (Note: This endpoint requires authentication. Returns {"detail":"Not authenticated"} without proper auth token.)

e. Verify Database & Model Loading:
   * Successful startup and API responses (especially from /predictive/predict) will implicitly test database connectivity (for alembic, though no auto-migrate is set up) and model loading.
   * Database is accessible on host port 5433 (User: digame_user, Pass: digame_password, DB: digame_db).

f. Stop Services: `docker-compose down` (Add -v to remove the postgres_data volume if you want to clear DB data).

### 3. Final Commit and Merge
a. ‚úÖ Fixed critical issues including circular imports and missing imports in the codebase.
b. After successfully testing the Dockerized application and ensuring model files are correct, commit any final changes (e.g., regenerated models, fixes found during testing).
c. Merge the updated code into your main development branch.
d. Consider creating a new branch for each major feature development in Phase 2.

## II. Project Structure & Feature Status (Based on Initial Blueprint)

## IV. Recent Progress & Immediate Next Steps

### Recent Accomplishments
- Fixed circular import issues in the codebase, particularly between predictive.py and related modules
- Added missing Body import in process_notes_router.py
- Successfully restarted Docker containers and verified backend service is running
- Verified all model files exist and have appropriate content
- Fixed duplicate router prefixes by removing prefixes from individual router files
- Updated NEXT_STEPS.md to reflect current project status and progress

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. ‚úÖ Complete verification of model files as outlined in section I.1
2. ‚úÖ Perform comprehensive testing of API endpoints to ensure all functionality works correctly
   - ‚úÖ Verified root endpoint works correctly
   - ‚úÖ Verified API docs are accessible
   - ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate router prefixes in all router files
   - ‚úÖ Fixed incorrect imports and removed unnecessary code
   - ‚úÖ Verified all API endpoints are now accessible (return authentication errors instead of not found)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement authentication to fully test protected endpoints
3. üîÑ Address any remaining import errors or code issues identified by linters
   - ‚úÖ Fixed critical issues that were causing runtime errors
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Many linter errors remain but are related to IDE configuration rather than actual code issues
4. Begin planning for Phase 2 features, starting with enhancing the behavioral modeling capabilities
5. Improve test coverage, particularly for the predictive modeling components

### Technical Debt to Address
- Refactor code to follow a more consistent module structure
- Improve error handling throughout the application
- Add comprehensive logging for better debugging
- Enhance documentation with more detailed API usage examples
- Consider implementing a more robust database migration strategy
- Implement proper authentication system for API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Fix duplicate router prefixes (e.g., `/predictive/predictive/` instead of just `/predictive/`) - Fixed by removing prefixes from individual router files

By addressing these items in order, we can ensure a stable foundation before moving on to the more advanced features outlined in the roadmap.
