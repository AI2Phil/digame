# Next Steps & Project Status

This document outlines the ongoing progress and next steps for the Digame platform development.

## I. Social Collaboration Features

### Project Matching API (`GET /api/social/project-matches`)
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the `Project` SQLAlchemy model and associated Pydantic schemas.
    *   The `GET /api/social/project-matches?user_id={user_id}` endpoint is functional in `digame/app/routers/social_collaboration.py`.
    *   Currently uses mock project data for matching users to projects based on skill alignment.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests have been added for this API endpoint.

### Peer Matching Frontend (`/social/find-peers`)
*   **Status:** Pending User Testing
*   **Details:**
    *   The `/social/find-peers` page has been created in `digame/frontend/src/pages/` and routing is configured in `App.jsx`.
    *   Functionality to fetch and display peer matches from `GET /api/social/users/{user_id}/peer-matches` is implemented.
    *   UI elements for selecting `match_type` (skills/learning partner) and filtering by skill are in place.
    *   Placeholder interaction (console logging/alert) on matched peer cards is implemented.
    *   Awaiting manual testing and feedback.

## II. Advanced Mobile Features

### Scheduled Notifications Backend
*   **Status:** Completed
*   **Details:**
    *   The `Notification` SQLAlchemy model, including a `scheduled_at` field, has been created in `digame/app/models/notification.py`.
    *   Pydantic schemas for notification creation, update, and response are defined in `digame/app/schemas/notification_schemas.py`.
    *   CRUD functions for notifications, supporting scheduled sending, are available in `digame/app/crud/notification_crud.py`.
    *   An Alembic database migration for the `notifications` table has been successfully created and applied (this also involved resolving a prior Alembic "multiple heads" issue).
    *   Comprehensive unit tests for the notification model, schemas, and CRUD operations have been added.

### Background App Refresh (Mobile - React Native)
*   **Status:** Pending User Testing
*   **Details:**
    *   Research conducted on `expo-background-fetch` and `expo-task-manager`.
    *   A basic background fetch task has been implemented in the `mobile/` application. This includes task definition, registration within `App.js`, and initial configuration in `app.json` for iOS (`UIBackgroundModes`).
    *   The current background task logs a message to confirm execution.
    *   Awaiting manual testing and feedback on a device/simulator.

## III. Future Work (Illustrative)

*   Integrate real project data for Project Matching.
*   Develop full profile views and connection request system for peer matching.
*   Implement the actual notification sending logic for scheduled notifications (e.g., via a background worker).
*   Enhance the mobile background fetch task to perform meaningful work (e.g., fetching new notifications).
*   Complete any remaining tasks from the original issue description.
